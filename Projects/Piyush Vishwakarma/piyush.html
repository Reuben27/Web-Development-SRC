<h2> My Story</h2>
<p>
    Rahul Rajiv Gandhi (Hindi pronunciation: [ˈraːɦʊl ˈɡaːndʱiː] (listen); born 19 June 1970) is an Indian politician and a member of the Indian Parliament, who represents the constituency of Wayanad, Kerala in the Lok Sabha. He previously represented the constituency of Amethi, Uttar Pradesh. He is a member of the main opposition party, the Indian National Congress and was the party president from December 2017 to July 2019. He is the chairperson of the Indian Youth Congress, the National Students Union of India and a trustee of the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and Rajiv Gandhi Charitable Trust. On 23 March 2023, he was convicted and sentenced to two years imprisonment by a court in Gujarat for a 2019 speech made against the Prime Minister Narendra Modi on defamation allegations related to his surname;[13] the conviction resulted in his disqualification from the Parliament.[3][4] However, in August 2023, the Supreme Court of India stayed his conviction, which allowed him to contest the next election and to be reinstated as an MP for Wayanad.[14] On 7 August 2023, he was reinstated as Member of Parliament.
